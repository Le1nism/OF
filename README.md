## Usage

### Clone the repo:

This is a nested repo, so be sure to clone the repo recursively, using the `--recursive` flag with the `git clone` command. Here's the syntax:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DIETI-DISTA-IoT/OF
```

This will clone the repository and all its submodules.

Alternatively, if you've already cloned the repository without the `--recursive` flag, you can use the following command to initialize and update the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will fetch and checkout the submodules recursively.


### Installation:

If you're using Windows to run the application, you may want to consider running the application on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which eliminates overhead caused by a VM or dualbooting.
[This guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) by Microsoft explains how to install and activate WSL with a user-chosen Linux distribution (recommended: Ubuntu 24-04).

You may want to create a virtual environment before installing python libraries:


   ```bash
   python3 -m venv <name-of-the-venv>
   ```

Activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source <name-of-the-venv>/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     <name-of-the-venv>\Scripts\activate
     ```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages and run Python scripts within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python installation. Install the required packages to launch the container manager from the `requirements.txt` file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Installing Docker
**On Windows:**

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the program.

**On WSL:**

Follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install Docker CE for the Ubuntu distribution (commands for other distributions can be found on the same website).
Perform the post installation steps, as shown [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
(Optional: you can also make Docker Daemon start on WSL initialization, by adding:
```
[boot]
systemd=true
```
to your `/etc/wsl.conf` within your WSL distribution and restart it with `wsl.exe --shutdown`.
To verify that Docker works, run `docker version` and `docker compose version` to verify that Docker Compose got installed as well.

## Installing Make
**On Windows:**
Download Make from the [GnuWin32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) project.
Run the installer and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` (inside Windows' Environment Variables).
Verify it works by opening a command prompt and executing `make --version`.

**On WSL:**
Run `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install make`.
Verify it works by executing `make --version`.


## Building vehicle images and dashboard:

Use `make all` to build the producer and consumer docker images:

    make all


### Launching:

**IMPORTANT** For using the wandb logging dashboard, you should have a file called .env in the project's root folder containing your wandb api key under the WANDB_API_KEY voice:

```.env file
# .env file content:

WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_api_key_here

```

Use `docker compose up` to start the whole cluster. Otherwise, start launching only the kafka and zookeeper

    docker compose up -d

Run the container manager script:

    python dashboard/app.py

Adjust configurations for this script in the `config/default.yaml` or create an ovverride `*.yaml` configuration on the `config/override` directory that you can use to override a subset of params. To launch an override conf, use:

    python dashboard/app.py override=my_conf_filename

Comand-line args can be sent also using the hydra syntax (i.e. no hyphens) and created appending `+` 

    python dashboard/app.py +foo=bar
